The raw CGM data includes the following key elements.

- **Date_Time**:
The exact date and time when the glucose level was recorded. This is crucial for tracking glucose trends and patterns over time. The timestamp is usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
- **CGM_Value**:
The measured glucose level at the given timestamp. This value is typically recorded in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and provides insight into the participant''''s glucose fluctuations throughout the day.'' as contents_md;
