CGM file metadata provides essential information about the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data files used in research studies. This metadata is crucial for understanding the context and quality of the data collected.

### Metadata Details

- **Metadata ID**: A unique identifier for the metadata record.
- **Device Name**: The name of the CGM device used to collect the data.
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the CGM device.
- **Source Platform**: The platform or system from which the CGM data originated.
- **Patient ID**: A unique identifier for the patient from whom the data was collected.
- **File Name**: The name of the uploaded CGM data file.
- **File Format**: The format of the uploaded file (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- **File Upload Date**: The date when the file was uploaded to the system.
- **Data Start Date**: The start date of the data period covered by the file.
- **Data End Date**: The end date of the data period covered by the file.
- **Study ID**: A unique identifier for the study associated with the CGM data.

  The raw CGM data includes the following key elements.

  - **Date_Time**:
  The exact date and time when the glucose level was recorded. This is crucial for tracking glucose trends and patterns over time. The timestamp is usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
  - **CGM_Value**:
  The measured glucose level at the given timestamp. This value is typically recorded in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and provides insight into the participant''s glucose fluctuations throughout the day.' as contents_md;
